I would like to thank Dr. Thomas Austin for introducing me to the field of information
flow security and programming language theory. He has been a great guide throughout
this journey.

I would also like to thank Dr. Chris Pollett and Dr. Jenny Lam for accepting to
be part of my panel, taking interest in my project, and for being patient throughout
this process.

Finally, I want to thank my family who have supported me in all my endeavors and
also my friends for tolerating my blabbering whenever something went wrong with
my project.
