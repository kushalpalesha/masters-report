\section{Future Work}
We explored the use of policy-agnostic programming in the DOM. Another interesting
area to explore on the client-side would be frameworks like Angular.js (angular).
Since, angular is an MVC framework the policy-agnostic programming solution for it
should be similar to what Yang et al~\cite{Jacqueline} have demonstrated with Jacqueline.

\section{Conclusion}
We saw how robust information flow controls can help prevent leaking of sensitive
data and how it has seen a very slow adoption rate because of it is difficult
for developers to write and maintain policy code. Policy-agnostic programming is
a promising approach to implement information flow control in your system with
very limited programmer burden.

We explored how policy agnostic programming would help on the client-side and were
successful in demonstrating how it helped prevent a known exfiltration attack to
which most modern browsers are vulnerable.
