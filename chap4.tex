\chapter{Future Work and Conclusion}
We explored the use of policy-agnostic programming in the DOM. Another interesting
area to explore on the client-side would be frameworks like Angular.js (angular).
Since, angular is an MVC framework, the policy-agnostic programming solution for it
should be similar to what Yang et al~\cite{Jacqueline} have demonstrated with Jacqueline.

We saw how robust information flow controls can help prevent leaking of sensitive
data and how it has seen very slow adoption because of the programmer burden to
write and maintain policy code. Policy-agnostic programming is a promising approach
to implement information flow controls in your system with very limited programmer
burden.

We explored how policy agnostic programming would look like on the client-side.
Through our Javascript implementation in Narcissus and dom.js we were successful
in demonstrating how it helped prevent a known exfiltration attack to which most
modern browsers are vulnerable.
